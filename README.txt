Welcome to my portfolio! This is a personal website celebrating my journey as a first-year student in computer science and involvement with projects centered around Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education, as well as past projects and contact information.


Navigating the Portfolio


Header Section:
Contains a profile picture and my name along with a tagline that goes: "Code with clarity, design with intention."


About Me Section:
Introducing who I am, my studies at Batangas State University, and my focus on SDG No. 4: Quality Education. It expounds barriers to quality education all over the world and the need for inclusive and equitable education for all.


Capstone Project Section:
Describes a group project I did in 12th grade. Its title is "AI-Powered Notes Generator." It helps the students get organized works as a result of quality learning resources compiled effectively because the materials, such as lectures and presentations, are converted into structured notes using AI, OCR, and NLP technologies.


SDG Relevance Section:
Justifies the importance of SDG 4 to my career ambitions while also clarifying how the AI notes generator is in line with this goal. The discussion on how technology can be harnessed for democratization of knowledge and how it can intensively render learning more accessible and applicable is included.


Contact Information Section:
Contains different ways to contact me via email and phone.


The SDG I have chosen is SDG 4: Quality Education, which very much suits my own personal life as well as what I aspire to achieve professionally. Quality education promises equal and inclusive education for all, accompanied by lifelong learning opportunities. This is crucial for me as a student of computer science, since I believe technology can bridge gaps when it comes to education and provide everyone with equal learning opportunities. My past capstone project and future career goals are all about the innovative application of technologies such as AI to improve accessibility and quality of educational resources.
