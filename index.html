            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Im a 1st Year Computer Science Student at Batangas State University. I myself would like to focus on SDG No.4, Quality Education ensures the inclusive, equitable education for all people for lifelong learning opportunities. It has been around such barriers as poverty, gender inequality, lack of infrastructure, among others, which stands in the way of attaining quality education globally. The objective includes everyone being able to access primary and secondary education, vocational training, and equal opportunities for higher education. </p>

            <h2>Capstone Project During 12th Grade</h2>
            <p>The caption for my group project during our 12th graduation application was an AI-powered notes generator which is a tool that converts educational reading material into detailed and structured notes; for example, lectures, PPTs, and handwritten notes captured using a camera from out mobile phone. It uses AI, OCR, and NLP to extract the key points, elaborate on the concepts, and finally compose the information extracted. Thus making it efficient and accessible on computers and mobile devices, thereby saving students' time, aiding in developing material for educators, and supporting lifelong enabling resources to be more holistic and customized for study by learners.
                As such, this project supports Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education because it addresses the gaps currently available in the quality of access to learning resources. It helps widen accessibility and address many learning needs, as well as enabling lifelong learning. With features such as multilingual support and real-time transcription, this tool may bring technology closer to helping make education more effective and attractive.</p>

            <h2>Importance of my Chosen SDG and its Relevance to my Project and my Career</h2>
            <p>As a computer programming student who is interested in innovation, I wish to pursue a career that involves creating accessible and affordable education through technology. We can use advanced tools, such as Artificial Intelligence, to help improve the quality of learning materials and democratize education. This freedom throws you into action with having solutions for both teachers and learners. My Group's project for our capstone in our 12th grade was an AI that automatically transforms written lectures and PowerPoint presentations into detailed notes represents Quality Education principles. It solves problems associated with lack of comprehensive resources and different learning needs by making personalized and easy-to-understand notes. It will further improve the understanding and retention of such good quality educational content, making it accessible to all students.
